# What is Innovation Fest?

Innovation Fest is an exciting event celebrating creativity and technological advancements at Birmingham City University. 
The festival occurs from May 19 to May 23, 2025. It showcases innovative projects from students in Computing, Engineering, 
and the Built Environment. It helps connect with industry professionals and develop real-world solutions.

As part of my curriculum, I had to record a pitch to show the idea for my final year project. After being hand-picked 
from over 300 students, I had to partake in pitching to an audience rather than a camera. Nevertheless, I will continue 
my healthcare micro-architecture project. I plan to show my dissertation about it next year.
